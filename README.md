Tell us what your idea is. 
 Describe in 250 words what the feature or service will do and how you’ll use Machine Learning to push the bar:
Sentiment analysis of email and words in chat to analyze the user behavior and predict if he has any suicidal tendency. Creating a centralized distributed dictionary to store words learn by users and classify dictionary into users their age wise. 


Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 
 Describe where your project is, how you could use Google’s help in the endeavor, and how you plan on using On-Device ML technology to bring the concept to life. The best submissions have a great idea combined with a concrete path of where you plan on going, which should include: 
●	(1) I have to start it from the scratch, but I might use some keyboard library code to get start with my idea.
●	(2) I need help to read sentences and words from google keyboard and store data in distributed storage or local device.
●	Access to store user words into dictionary and getting user’s personalized detail.
●	(3) I can complete the keyboard interaction with Google Keyboard and my custom keyboard to read words and create a distributed local storage in device. (1st Dec 2019)
●	Personalized dictionary and a storage method like google drive or a cloud storage. (20th Dec 2019)
●	User behavior analysis on daily basis and giving text and sentences a score based on user’s daily interaction. (30th Jan 2020)
●	Algorithm to get sentiment analysis of user. (30th April 2020)
●	Updating emergency contact if a suicidal behavior is found.
